How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It made me check the current version with a stable version easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

It helps keep track of the progress, which in turn helps the progress
along the development cycle.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

pros: gives you control and a semantically meaningful version control
cons: at the discretion of the user and suspectible to human weaknesses

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Use cases are different. Git is mostly used for code whereas gdocs is used for
independent documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
Git log to search for the exact commit 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
I could always get back to a previous version and check its veracity.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

To maintain all my projects (including coding and latex papers )
