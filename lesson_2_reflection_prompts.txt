How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the area which can be committed to a repository. It offers us
a chance to exactly select the files that we want to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Add only those files that are part of the logical change to the staging area
and commit them before repeating the steps for each logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

For experimental features or even to make a copy without effecting the
original master.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

All the commits and the branchoffs off the master (or a branch) are shown and
this helps us checkout whichever branch we need.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

By merging two branches, the other branch gets merged and is removed as a
branch. 


What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

merging leading to unintended behaviour.
