When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To share the project over the internet with others or even to have a backup in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Otherwise it may be in conflict with my local version or even undesirable
	due to readiness.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks - make a copy of another person's repository on github
clones - from a copy of a remote/local reposity on local machine
branch - make a copy of the commit to pursue an other version of the code on
the local machine

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	Easier to check while working offline. And to check diff etc.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

	Make local copies of a central repository and have one "authorized" person 
	merge the collaborators' changes to their respective local copies.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
	
	New/experimental feature mainly. Master is too linear for me. And its fine
	as long as there are no collaborators. I'll use branches frquently.
